## Summary​
We propose a benchmark suite for neural network verification for systems (NN4Sys). This suite includes verification benchmark for learned index, learned cardinality, learned Internet congestion control, learned adaptive bitrate, learned distributed system scheduler, which are five tasks that apply neural networks to solve traditional tasks for systems.
