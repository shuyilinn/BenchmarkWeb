"NN4SysBench is a benchmarkÂ suite for neural network verification, incorporating applications from the domain of neural network for computer systems (NN4Sys). This suite includes verification benchmark for learned index, learned bloom filter, learned cardinality, learned Internet congestion control, learned adaptive bitrate, learned distributed system scheduler, which are six tasks that apply neural networks to solve traditional tasks for systems.
